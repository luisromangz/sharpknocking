#summary Netfilter's ip_tables .Net wrapper throught iptables command

== What's this? ==

It's a new subproyect that aims to create a managed wrapper to handle rules in the netfilter firewall


== Details ==

Currently the code that is under the SharpKnocking.NetfilterFirewall namespace is being refactorized. That code uses the iptables command-line tool to change the current rule set so currently is a wrapper against that command.

~~In a future it should be better to use some library or API to change the current rule set.~~

It looks like that the better existing api is inside the sources of iptables and is not a valid api to work against it (it can change between revisions). The recommended way to do things is using the commands: iptables, iptables-save, iptables-restore.

A good tip is that the iptables-save can be used to issues commands on demand just writting a COMMIT each time you want the last bunch of command being executed.

== Objetives ==

The main objetive is to provide a object-oriented approach to every option but with some limitations. In the long term it should be easily extensible throught new targets and matches extensions and we should provide an api to do so.

Another important thing is a good and intuitive UI to mess with the rules easily.

~~The initial version will be uploaded and integrated into svn tree in some weeks.~~
There is now some code in the svn under the directory IptablesNet.
