*Project blog up*

Since yesterday the blog activity got restored.

The guilty is the spammers that send it using talkback links to the blog.

Dammed spammers!

*Project blog down*

This Sunday morning i discovered that our blog only prints this when it is accessed:

_ JAWS Fatal Error:_
_Failed to fetch enabled data for registry_

We still don't know the causes for this but we will recover it soon.
