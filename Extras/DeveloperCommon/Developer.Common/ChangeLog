• Improved implementation of the BaseSystemCommand (renamed from BaseCommandWrapper)
• The implementation of new derived system commands is pretty easy as they only have to care about their particular behaviour.
• Worked a bit the iptables-save and iptable-restore system commands. The former works and the latter is more complex and is still under development.
• Improved the implementation of the options and removed old files that where hanging around here.
• Moved TextInputCommand and TextOutputCommand from Developer.Common.Unix.SystemCommands to Developer.Common.SystemCommands as they are very generic.
• Added support to execute a command as a different user
