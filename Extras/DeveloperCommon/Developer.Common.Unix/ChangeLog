	* SystemCommands/UnixTextOutputSysCmd.cs: Changed timeout timer to 5000
	  millis
	
	  Uncommented kill timeout methods.
	* SystemCommands/BaseUnixSysCmd.cs: Renamed the constructor parameter
	  requiresRoot for authRequired.
	
	  Moved the code in GetNewProcess to OnAuthRequired (new method
	  overload) and changed a bit to make it more simple and to not use
	  gksu when the current user is the one who is going to execute the
	  process.
	
	* SystemCommands/UnixInteractiveSysCmd.cs: 
	
	* SystemCommands/WhichSysCmd.cs: Changed base class to
	  UnixTextOutputsysCmd
	* SystemCommands/IptablesSysCmd.cs: Unused
	* SystemCommands/LocateSysCmd.cs: Changed base class to
	  UnixTextOutputSysCmd
	* SystemCommands/IptablesRestoreSysCmd.cs: Some cosmetical changes
	* Native/UnixNative.cs: Changed Native/UnixNative.cs. Added new method
	  overload to create lock file that stores in it the pid of the
	  process. The older overload now calls this new one with
	  Int32.MaxValue as second parameter.
