This project has support for autotools so you can do the traditional 
configure-make-install dance.

INSTALLING INSTRUCTIONS

You need first to follow the instructions to build it from sources. Then go to 
the SharpKnocking directory in the root of the sources and type this command as root:

	#make install

To unisntall go to the same directory and type this:

	#make unisntall

BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS

First get the latest sources from svn using this command:

    svn co https://sharpknocking.googlecode.com/svn/trunk

Then you will need a working installation of at least mono 1.2.3 with gtk# 
libraries 2.10 and the lastest version monodevelop.
Simply open the solution file iSharpKnocking.mds with monodevelop and select 
"build solution" from the build menu and you will get the build.

If you prefer to build it by console you can use the traditional steps:

	#./configure --prefix={YourPrefix}
	#make

GTK-SHARP-2.10 REQUIRED!

You must have gtk-sharp version 2.10 or latest to build from sources. If you 
don't have it google for a package and install it. Once you have it installed 
you must set/update de enviroment variable called PKG_CONFIG_PATH prepending it
with the path of the directory where the .pc files for the libraries are.

For example, if I built gtk-sharp from sources and i installed it under 
/usr/local prefix i do:

	#export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH

And then I can compile the sources. You may need to set some extra enviroment 
variable depending on the type of setup for mono you have.

WARNING - PROJECT NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE!

We try to keep the svn sources as stable as we can but expect build issues 
often as this is a very new project and we haven't reached a 1.0 version yet (at the writting time of this note we are in 0.1 :p).

WIKI

We maintain a wiki with all the related information about the project in the 
project page at google's code hosting. If you have questions or want to do a bug
report this is the best source to look:

You can also download the latest develoment version from the subversion at 
google code or the latest stable package.
