By default the binaries are under /usr/local/sharpknocking/bin or 
/opt/sharpknocking/bin and some scripts are placed under /bin to launch the 
daemon and graphical applications.

INSTALLING INSTRUCTIONS

To install first execute install.sh as root. This will copy all the binaries
to the correct folder updating an existing installation if required. It also 
adds the group and user sharpknocking to your system.
Then you have to update the sudoers file to give permission for the user
sharpknocking to access as root, without requiring password, the commands 
iptables, iptables-save and iptables-restore.

To uninstall first execute uninstall.sh as root. This will delete all the
binaries, scripts, the user and the group sharpknocking but the user preferences
are keept.
Then you have to update the sudoers file to remove any references to the user
or group sharpknocking since it doesn't exist anymore.

COMPILING INSTRUCTIONS

First get the latest sources from svn using this command:

    svn checkout https://forja.rediris.es/svn/csl-csknocking

Or try with the daily sources tarball (generated automatically):

    https://forja.rediris.es/tarballs.php?group_id=129

Then you will need a working installation of at least mono 1.2.3 with gtk# 
libraries and monodevelop 0.13.
Simply open the solution file SharpKnocking.mds with monodevelop and select 
"build solution" from the build menu and you will get the build.

We try to keep the svn sources as stable as we can but expect compiling issues 
often.
