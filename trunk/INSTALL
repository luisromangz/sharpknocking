This project has support for autotools so you can do the traditional 
configure-make-install dance.

INSTALLING INSTRUCTIONS

You need first to follow the instructions to get it compiled. Then go to the 
SharpKnocking directory in the root of the sources and type this command as root:

	#make install

To unisntall go to the same directory and type this:

	#make unisntall

COMPILING INSTRUCTIONS

First get the latest sources from svn using this command:

    svn checkout https://forja.rediris.es/svn/csl-csknocking

Or try with the daily sources tarball (generated automatically):

    https://forja.rediris.es/tarballs.php?group_id=129

Then you will need a working installation of at least mono 1.2.3 with gtk# 
libraries 2.10 and monodevelop 0.13.
Simply open the solution file ManagedSource.mds with monodevelop and select 
"build solution" from the build menu and you will get the build.

If you prefer to build it by console you can use the traditional steps:

	#./configure --prefix={YourPrefix}
	#make

GTK-SHARP-2.10 REQUIRED!

You must have gtk-sharp version 2.10 to get the sources compiled. If you don't have it
search the net for a package and install it. Once you have it installed you must 
set/update de enviroment variable called 
PKG_CONFIG_PATH prepending it with the path of the directory where the .pc files for 
the libraries are.
For example, if i built gtk-sharp from sources and i installed it under /usr/local 
prefix i do:

	#export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH

And then i can compile the sources. You may need to set some extra enviroment variable 
depending on the type
of setup for mono you have.

WARNING - PROJECT NOT IN PRODUCTION

We try to keep the svn sources as stable as we can but expect compiling issues often as
this is a very new project and we haven't reached a 1.0 version yet (at the writting
time of this note we are in 0.1 :p).

WIKI

We maintain a wiki with all the related information about the project. If you have questions or want to do a
bug report this is the best source to look:

You can also download the latest develoment version from the subversion at google or 
the latest stable package.
