-- SHARP KNOCKING PROJECT --

 This project is a implementation of the port knocking principles (see 
www.portknocking.org) in c# for every *nix flavour that have a kernel with
 iptables (1.3.5 at least) and mono (1.2.3 at least).

-- iSharpKnocking PROJECT --

 This project is the evolution and extension of the previous project as a totally new development over our knowledge and code base that aims higher in our feature list to make it a better project.

 iSharpKnocking project developers continue to develop over the sharpKnocking svn and to write in the sharpKnocking blog and wiki. This is more a new way of doing things than a totally new project itself.
